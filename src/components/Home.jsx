    <h2>Hey Y'all ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤ </h2>
    <p>
      My name is Adrian Lanier and I am an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before coming to Chapel Hill, I was a dedicated trumpet player performing and competing at the national level. During my time at UNC, I am able to utilize many of the skills I developed during this time to find success in my coursework and take on projects that will continue to facilitate my growth as a computer scientist. I aim to leverage what I learn in and out of school to make positive and impactful contributions to our society, culture, and environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am proficient in Python, Java/JavaScript, and React, with a solid background in full-stack web development and data analysis. Looking toward the future, I want to learn more about AI and ML applications and utilize them in my future projects and begin developing applications for iOS and Android using technologies such as React Native.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from CS, I really enjoy thrifting, collecting vinyls, traveling, exercising, and have a strong appreciation for music and nature. I am a huge fan of Carolina basketball, Guayaki Yerba Mate, trying new foods, and the Oxford comma.
